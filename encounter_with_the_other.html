        <p>Let me begin by thanking Karen Sturges for arranging for my visit with you today.  It is a pleasure to be worshiping with you at this beautiful spot.</p>

        <p>The longer I serve as a pastor, the more appreciation I have for our lectionary, the system of assigned readings in three-year cycles.  Without that we preachers would be likely to cherry-pick favorite passages, ones that we tend to be comfortable with, or find reassuring and not necessarily challenging.  Today's passage presents us with a perplexing picture of Jesus, one that I believe speaks directly to us today in this perplexing times.</p>

        <p>I live in Boston now, serving at Trinity Church.  I grew up in the South, in Virginia and North Carolina.  I remember when my high school was integrated by three brave young women of color.  Though my city was relatively peaceful, I knew people in places where hooded Klan members marched at night and sheriffs turned water cannons and dogs on young people marching for voting rights and sitting at all-white lunch counters.  It was out of those experiences that I answered the call for clergy-especially white clergy-to come to Charlottesville Virginia last weekend.</p>

        <p>With the intensity of that experience for me, with the sense that many of us in this country are experiencing heartbreak and dismay and anger at the blatant signs of racism, we assemble as people of faith to listen for God's word.  And we have this passage from Matthew.</p>

        <p>Today's gospel story of Jesus and the Canaanite woman raise troubling questions for us.  It looks like Jesus is guilty of racism.  "Jesus, what were you thinking?"  I want to ask.  What an embarrassing story.</p>

        <p>Jesus has been having a tough time of it.  The Pharisees-the religious leaders of the day-keep trying to trap him with their questions.  Jesus needs a vacation.  Matthew says that he goes to the district of Tyre and Sidon-a place beyond Galilee, north-on the coast.  Like those of us from Boston who come up to Maine.  Maybe there he will find some privacy and relaxation.</p>

        <p>But there's to be no peace. Some woman keeps pestering him.  She's a Canaanite woman, a Gentile, not Jewish.  Her daughter has a mental illness, and she wants Jesus to heal her.  She follows him around, shouting, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me."  The disciples want her sent away.  Jesus loses his cool.  He tries to blow her off, but she persist and even demonstrates her cleverness.  Jesus is impressed with her faith.  He gives her what she wants.</p>

        <p>On its face, this story certainly conveys a different image of Jesus than the one we usually see.  Jesus seems unconcerned with her suffering.  He tells her that his mission is not to her people. (Doesn't that remind you of some people's infuriating reply when asked to do something they don't want to do, "It's not in my job description"?)  And he refers to the woman by a crude racial slur:  Jews used the term "dog" to refer to Gentiles.  But the woman looks beyond his words.  She continues to refer to him with terms of respect, and she kneels before him.</p>

        <p>It's possible to see this story as Jesus' own wrestling with his personal mission.  What is God calling him to do and to be?  How broadly should he travel, how much should he reach beyond his own people? So maybe we can rationalize Jesus' initial response to this woman.  But we also have to admit that Jesus is frustrated, and he responds with excessive harshness.  Ironically, after the previous passage in which he says that words matter, that they proceed from the heart, Jesus engages in offensive speech. Then, to his credit, he realizes it immediately and takes corrective action.  Poet and translator Stephen Mitchell says that this story "shows us a Jesus who makes a mistake and admits it with humility and good humor, a Jesus who is flexible enough to learn.  From a Gentile yet.  From a woman!"  (Mitchell, The Gospel According to Jesus, p. 206).</p>

        <p>Jesus grows from this encounter.  Here he says that his mission is only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.  By the end of Matthew's gospel, Jesus is sending his friends into "the world" with a command to "make disciples of all nationsâ€¦"  Certainly the mission has broadened.  We go from a narrow definition of mission, only to the Jews, to an expansive view of bringing the name of Jesus to the whole world.  And it's a personal encounter that is part of this transformation.  The Canaanite woman helps Jesus acknowledge his exclusion and enlarge his mission.</p>

        <p>Personal encounters are important in helping us rethink our position, to learn to confront our prejudices and fears and move beyond them.  A new book entitled The Vanishing Neighbor  argues that we Americans have lost the opportunities for such encounters, and the effects are profound in our communal life.  Author Marc Dunkelman draws a picture of increasing isolation in our lives as technology, politics, economics, and geography make it possible for us to tailor our lives and encounters to those with whom we are intimately connected (an "inner ring") and those on an "outer ring" of impersonal transactions.</p>

        <p>What has been lost is what he calls the "middle ring" in which we directly encounter those who are different from us, with whom we may disagree.  It is in this ring that we learn to hold conversations, to argue with respect, and to learn from each other.  Examples of this ring include neighborhoods in which peoples of a variety of ethnicities and class are casually but frequently thrown together along the street, in the park, or at school.  Another example is a house of worship which draws peoples from diverse backgrounds.  It is in such places, Dunkelman observes, that we learn how to respect each other, and in some cases gain enough trust to share our personal stories.</p>

        <p>It is counter-cultural to look for opportunities to speak and listen across differences-differences of race, or economic status, or educational levels, or gender identity, or age.  It is challenging to find opportunities for real dialogue.  It is relatively easy to stay in an echo-chamber in which we feel satisfied and supported by what we hear, rarely challenging ourselves to look at biases and prejudices, or systemic structures that preserve the status quo.</p>

        <p>We don't get to know very much about the Canaanite woman as she encounters Jesus.  What we do see is a woman with enough courage and tenacity to challenge Jesus' definition of his ministry.  Presumably her concern for the welfare of her daughter outweighs her adherence to social conventions.  She helps him see her needs as real.  And it changes him.</p>

        <p>Helping each other see our blind spots is risky and challenging work.  At a recent antiracism workshop I heard one woman of color speak movingly of the burden of being the one who is always expected to call out evidences of white privilege and unacknowledged racist behavior.  "I sometimes wish that my white friends would do some of this heavy lifting," she sighed.</p>

        <p>Becoming self-reflective and alert to the oppression in our society are challenging matters.  It's a lot easier to say with relief, "I am not one of those alt-right types!" We need to be persistent and forgiving with each other in helping to identify the marks of racism and bigotry in al its forms.  We will make mistakes.  In today's Gospel Jesus-the one we believe is the perfect demonstration of divine love-shows his human side.  He gets it wrong too.</p>

        <p>The complexity of this journey for me is, on the one hand, the humility I need to learn from others, and on the other, keeping the clarity of speaking out against what is blatantly evil.  That was the dilemma of the people of faith in Charlottesville.  How do we come together to confront hatred and terrorism with a nonviolent response?  It is the work that Dr. Martin Luther King and others helped to foster:  the difficult work of self-control in the face of hateful speech and intimidating actions, trying to stand firmly for love while de-escalating the violence.  In Charlottesville, Dr. Cornell West was one of the speakers in the prayer services that were held prior to the marches.  He was energetic and forceful in his preaching.  And he was clear that hatred cannot overcome hatred.  Only love can do that.  A fierce love that stands up to evil and says, "There is a better way."</p>

        <p>That is the faith that is given to us.  It takes work and discipline and willingness to admit our failures.  It also takes courage to move across differences and embrace those who have been marginalized and terrorized.  It takes imagination to discern a way forward.  To know when to speak and when to listen.  To know when to stand and when to march.  To know when to negotiate and when to say, "No more."  It is a life-time journey.</p>
         
        <p>God challenges us with a mission to move beyond fear, to reach out to others, as Jesus does with the Canaanite woman, and to welcome all into God's healing embrace.  Christian churches have historically been part of the struggle for human rights.  But we have also been complicit and in some cases openly supportive of systems of oppression and exclusion.  Too often the gospel that we preach with our lives is still based on privilege and prejudice.  May God continue to open our eyes to the injustice, suffering, and oppression around us.  May we learn what it means to help build a beloved community, both inside these walls and in the world around us.</p>
